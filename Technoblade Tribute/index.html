                                             Maybe one day we will be able to ultimately eradicate all types of cancer, but for now all we can do is help spread awareness and donate to organizations that help fight the spread of cancer. 
                                            Technoblade was an inspiration for many people. His humor was dry and dark, which drew in people for how relatable he was. He was never over the top with his content and felt like talking to an old friend.
                                             The relationship he had with his viewers was never a friendship, but he did care for us; he cared about our opinions and thoughts just as much we cared about his. Thank you Technoblade, for all the years of entertainment you gave us, and I hope that you are resting well.

                                        <p class="font-italic">Alexander "Alex" † (June 1, 1999 - June 2022 [aged 23]),[1] better known online as Technoblade (or simply Techno), was an American gamer and YouTuber​​​​​ known for his Minecraft content and collaborations with other YouTubers and Twitch streamers. 
                                            He was a member of the Minecraft server Dream SMP and a friendly rivalry of Dream.</p>In Technoblade's video "the quest for the [PIG] rank", he says that he created the channel for the sole purpose of being confident and getting 10 million subscribers. But, when he met someone with the 3-coloured [McProHosting] rank he quickly decided that he "needed to get an even cooler rank". Technoblade came up with the idea to have a uniquely colored rank called the [PIG] rank. When he tweeted Hypixel how many subscribers he would need to acquire this rank, Hypixel responded with 10 million.

                                            This was apparently "all part of his master plan" and supposedly increased his motivation to tryhard his YouTube career even more than usual. Despite not having reached 10 million subscribers at the time, he still gained the [PIG], [PIG+], [PIG++], and [PIG+++] ranks after Hypixel donated in his Minecraft Monday stream, stating that he would get [PIG] rank if he'd win the tournament. Following that victory, another plus sign would be added to his rank with each extra win in the event. The [PIG+++……] later became a meme and an inside joke among his audience.
